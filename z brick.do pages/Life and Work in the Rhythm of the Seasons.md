**Based on the eastern philosophy of The Dao, and the book that Dr. Jaap Voigt wrote on the topic, I will show you how to synchronize your life and your work with the flow of the seasons, to find your balance and unlock your natural creativity.**

Our (western) society has created a rhythm that is based on the idea that it should always be spring or summer. This doctrine of unending growth has many detrimental effects. In our culture, stillness has been eliminated and we’ve become burnt-out.

Nature teaches us that after every period of growth, a time of rest and stillness is necessary. After summer, fall and winter come, for good reason! After every breath in, the out-breath is one of relaxation and in this stillness, we build up new energy. After winter, must come spring.

Since we as humans are a part of nature, we are also part of the seasons; you could say the seasons live through us. If we let go and allow this to happen, we get the chance to live truthfully, creatively, from the inside out.

**This workshop contains:**

- Lecture & Conversation
- Meditation
- Creative Exercise

**After this workshop the participants will:**

- reconnect to their understanding of nature
- be able to adjust to seasonal priorities
- have reactivated their natural creativity
- feel refreshed, inspired and unblocked
- do more meaningful and effective work — closer to their life's work.

**The contents of this workshop will always be relevant to the current month and the current season, and includes actionable questions and tasks.**

**Ivan Gonzales, Developer in Residence @ Founders and Coders, says this about the "Seasons":**

> _Simon's “Life and Work in the Rhythm of the Seasons” workshop opened my eyes to a new perspective on my work. In the months after, I've changed my schedule significantly, which gave me a lot more space to follow my curiosity. I ended up investing more time in meditation, relationships and connection, while still contributing meaningfully to my job. At the same time, my baseline happiness went way up and my everything got way better. It’s hard to describe it._ 

**I've hosted this workshop as a salon regularly on the platform** [**Interintellect**](https://interintellect.com)**, and Interintellect founder & CEO** [**Anna Gát**](https://twitter.com/annagat) **has this to say about my work:**

> _The Interintellect community loves Simon's salons on the nature of living and working. He enchants attendees with his grounding presence, and his innovative metaphors offer clarity and inspiration for leaders and creatives. We take a screenshot of every salon hosted, and I never see as many smiling faces as when Simon is hosting :)_
