**What if we had an evolving metaphor, a living image, to describe our life and work make it more joyful? "The Village" is a workshop which invites you to take a step back from your life and work, in order to gain an overview and to understand yourself better.**

**Ivan Gonzales, Developer in Residence @ Founders and Coders, says this about the "Seasons":**

> _Simon's “Life and Work in the Rhythm of the Seasons” workshop opened my eyes to a new perspective on my work. In the months after, I've changed my schedule significantly, which gave me a lot more space to follow my curiosity. I ended up investing more time in meditation, relationships and connection, while still contributing meaningfully to my job. At the same time, my baseline happiness went way up and my everything got way better. It’s hard to describe it._ 

**Hawraa Alsayegh, MSc, about my original workshop "The Village":**

> _The Village unlocked a journey of self-discovery for me. At a challenging time during my first master's program, I was seeking inspiration and encouragement. Participating in these sessions filled me with an energy I didn't realize I needed. [...] I wholeheartedly recommend engaging with this experience and working with Simon. His unique and creative perspective, coupled with a passion for sharing knowledge and experiences, in the long run might just change your life, as it did mine."_
