My life is strongly defined by who I work with. Here are my projects, which are all tied to my good friends and long time collaborators.

## ADFL / nowMedia — Podcast Production

ADFL is my collaboration with [Sebastian Bracht](https://sol1dude.com). We produce philosophical podcasts for clients, in which I produce and host deep and inspiring conversations, and Sebastian curates rich and flawless listening experiences.

Sebastian is my favorite musician and vocalist, [you can look at his work and book him here](https://sol1dude.com).

## Purpose of Gaming — Documentary Movie

Purpose of Gaming is my collaboration with [Paul Schlesier](https://www.paulschlesier.com). We are changing the narrative on how video games are perceived — not just as a past time, or an industry, or a type of sports, but as an important medium in producing meaning and transformation in people’s lives. So far we’ve created:

- the Purpose of Gaming Blueprint, a booklet that captures the core intention of the project. [Download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17JWk6QVk5XXJE83gYdhdDLc-3trnZTZJ/view?usp=share_link).
- three podcast episodes, containing interviews with content creators about their gaming life story. [Listen or watch (in German)](https://open.spotify.com/show/7CMLMla5uEl4iSDgskjPwR?si=d549dcea01e14e25).
- one commissioned documentary, portraying Thomas Schmidt (CEO of gaming agency Strafejump), his team and his “purpose of gaming” life story. [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/4mY1gMSCiX8).

We are currently looking for co-production and funding for a full-length documentary movie.

If this project interests you in any way, please get in touch. We’re happy to talk! Email [pog [at] nowmedia [dot] org](mailto:pog@nowmedia.org).

Paul is my favorite filmmaker, you can [look at his work and book him here](https://paulschlesier.com).

## Spiritual Mischief — Philosophy School

Spiritual Mischief is my collaboration with Louis Bijl de Vroe. Originally conceived as a podcast, of which we only released a few chaotic (but good!) episodes, we’ve spent most of our time working on shared philosophy, I Ching interpretations and giving classes on Life and Work in the Rhythm of the Seasons (after Jaap Voigt).

We’re an insightful and entertaining duo and are happy to discuss opportunities. You can reach out to us here: [spitmief [at] nowmedia [dot] org](mailto:spitmief@nowmedia.org).

Louis is my favorite philosopher, you can [look at his work and book him here](https://www.louisbijldevroe.com).
