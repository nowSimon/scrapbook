Simon has a remarkably sharp mind and an even brighter spirit. He excels at pinpointing the most critical areas for growth and boldly addressing them head-on. In doing so, he empowers you to cultivate the courage and openness you need to challenge yourself—especially in the areas you might have previously overlooked.

His guidance has been instrumental in my personal and professional transformations. With remarkable agility, Simon steps into whatever role serves you best in the moment—whether it’s a supportive friend, a thought-provoking critic, an insightful consultant, or a wise advisor.

If you sense it’s time for a shift in your work or personal life but aren’t sure what needs changing or how to tackle it, Simon’s approach is a game-changer. His ability to inspire clarity and motivation is truly extraordinary, making him an invaluable catalyst for meaningful, lasting growth.

When we started our journey with Simon, we did not know what we were up to with our business. Over the course of our session, we did not only find a clear path forward for our business, but also ourselves. The mixture of business and mentally stimulating exchanges helped us to grow our business and ourselves likewise.

When I started my sessions with Simon, I had no idea what to expect, but now I’m amazed with what has come from it.  With an approach that felt somewhere in between therapy and professional development, Simon was able to get to the core of who I am and who I am trying to be and guide me forward.

Simon is one of three people I go to when I have a Big Question on an interpersonal or mission level. He has a special way of cutting through to the heart of the matter. He’s spent his 40 days and nights in the desert and came back with gold. As such I think he’s particularly well equipped for soul-shaped inquiries and quests. His music taste is what some would call “excellent” as well.

I’ve worked with Simon in evolving capacities for over a year now. He has helped me in navigating interpersonal tensions while staying steadfast to my truth. And he has shown me how to balance chaos and order in structures that support my creativity. On a personal level, Simon sees me in a way that very very few people can. His support has been such a gift.

Simon brings a lot of presence to any conversation, gentle and supportive but able to question an assumption or two when that's needed. By intuitively following what's alive in the moment, he brings out some of my best insights and ideas, and encourages me to slow down and dig into inspirations I might otherwise hurry past. His rooted stance and his way of listening feel very nourishing.

Working with Simon was surprisingly rewarding, even though i didn't have a clear sense of what i needed at first. despite only meeting recently, I had the feeling I was talking with an old friend, and his insightful questions had me looking at my own struggles with fresh eyes. He showed respect for my self-authorship, yet gave solid advice and clear judgment when asked. Starting with just a vague sense of relationship woes, I came away from the conversation with new knowledge of myself, a clear plan of action, and refreshed hope about my relationships.

Simon's “Life and Work in the Rhythm of the Seasons” workshop opened my eyes to a new perspective on my work. In the months after, I've changed my schedule significantly, which gave me a lot more space to follow my curiosity. I ended up investing more time in meditation, relationships and connection, while still contributing meaningfully to my job. At the same time, my baseline happiness went way up and my everything got way better. It’s hard to describe it.

Simon has been a dependable and insightful mentor. I know I can count on him to untangle my knottiest problems and help put words to the fears that I have had trouble articulating. A clear thinker who leads with compassion, I can't recommend him enough.

I feel incredibly grateful to have been working with Simon for the last 9 months.

Working with Simon has been a very rewarding experience. His easy-going and friendly demeanour immediately put me at ease. Our sessions had an organic flow, they were concentrated but also at times filled with laughter, making it feel like a chat among friends with a clear purpose. What impressed me most was Simon's balance in communication – he is an attentive listener, asks thought-provoking questions and also shares his insightful opinions when needed.

Simon's guidance supported my current work in several ways. He helped me prioritise my various projects, assisted me in making some difficult decisions and guided me through planning my yearly cycle, suggesting effective tools tailored to my needs along the way. Our sessions were incredibly efficient; we accomplished a great deal in a short amount of time. I am very grateful for Simon's support and would highly recommend his services to anyone seeking a thoughtful and effective coach.

Simon is an attentive and perceptive listener. He has a calm, wise presence. The first time we ever hung out one-on-one, he gave me several pieces of advice that turned out to be exactly the missing pieces of perspective I needed at the time.

This is an unsolicited testimonial because I just think Simon is great.

Simon introduced me to the magical concept of ”The Village” over a year ago. This revelation unlocked a journey of self-discovery for me. At a challenging time during my first master's program, I was seeking inspiration and encouragement. Participating in these sessions filled me with an energy I didn't realize I needed. It sparked my imagination about my ideal living environment — picturing my metaphorical garden, envisioning my house, and considering the walls that allowed me to be my true, unguarded self.

This concept of always having a ‘garden’ where I could freely express myself led me to reevaluate what I truly desired and how it fits into my personal ’village’. It transformed my perspective on life both professionally as a researcher and as in my personal life. My colleagues and professors were captivated as I shared the story of the ‘village’, recognizing the profound simplicity and importance of bringing such a vision to reality.

This experience has been pivotal in shaping my decision to continue my education at a research institute and university in London, further refining what my ’new village‘ looks like. It has taught me the joy of manifesting and implementing the village model in my life. I wholeheartedly recommend engaging with this experience and working with Simon. His unique and creative perspective, coupled with a passion for sharing knowledge and experiences, in the long run might just change your life, as it did mine.
