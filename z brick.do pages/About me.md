## Bio:

I have 15 years of experience in active contemplation and execution on how to live, love and labor well.

I’m most interested in universalisms and first principles. I’ve asked myself what living well means to me, until I couldn’t break it down any further. On the way I’ve applied my findings in my own life. If you can’t walk the walk, don’t talk the talk : )

This has been a self directed study process, which has led me through productivity, business and market principles, behavioral psychology, philosophy, meditation, fitness, spirituality, creativity and love.

On my recent [5-year sabbatical](https://open.substack.com/pub/nowsimon/p/the-sabbatical?r=e06m1&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) I‘ve separated my life from work to identify what is at the core of living well. In this time I analyzed my own life heavily and made deep explorations into the essential matters of identity, time and creativity. I’ve also educated myself in the fields of psychology, personal development, meditation and trauma modulation.

Philosophically I’m naturally influenced by western philosophy, but I’ve invited the east into my world through Daoism and the I Ching, which I’ve both studied and applied extensively. Fitting the current times, my philosophy focuses on the cyclical nature of living and working, active change and transformation and sustainability, both in the inner and the outer worlds.

Previously at Twitch I actively advised and supported north of 100 livestreamers / content creators in matters of creativity and business development, and by extent, business philosophy. Many of them are now defining forces in the German speaking entertainment landscape.

Over the years I’ve been a guide and advisor for matters of life, love and labor for my close friends, family and a few selected clients, who all report and show high satisfaction and quality in their life.
