## What people said about TREEWEEK 2024:

"I loved the people, dancing activities, spontaneous singing and playing instruments, all the philosophical conversations and debates about religion and spirituality, and lots more. But most of all the people."

"The beauty of everyone. It felt like watching a great novel on film. Altogether, the week-long experience registered as one long psychedelic trip that wasn’t chemical in nature.  
But specifics: mostly the conversation, which was of high quality and found left and right.   
The sauna was FANTASTIC in terms of both physical and social pleasure (I don’t get to spend much time with naked men…)."

"Beautiful three days and nights of warmth, inspiration, letting go, love, amazing food AROUND THE CLOCK und Erkenntnisse."

"I cleared up a big knot in my relationship with one of the attendees. This went wayy better than I could have expected. I heard of two other friends having similar clear-ups on the same day."

"A few super deep moments of connection with people, worth so much to get those. I experienced at least two major transformative moments."

"TREEWEEK was a kind of Gesamtkunstwerk - an artwork composed of all art forms (costume, design, music, dialog). Although it was led by the inimitable Simon (a most glorious host), he, too, was part of the artwork as much as all of us, the house, the trees, and the stars."

## All the deetz:

### What is this?

TREEWEEK TWO is an all-inclusive self organized summer camp, retreat and party, hosted by yours truly [Simon Ohler](https://twitter.com/simon_ohler), the one and only [Emergent Vibe](https://twitter.com/emergentvibe) & our team.

If you’re a Twitter person: TREEWEEK TWO continues the line of [Vibecamp](https://vibe.camp/), [Jesscamp](http://www.liberalis.events/jesscamps/jesscamp4.html), [Xiqweek](https://xiqweek.brick.do), [Vibehole](https://vibehole.brick.do/), [Richfest](https://richdecibels.com/richfest.html), and of course, [TREEWEEK](https://simonohler.com/treeweek), as a relaxed, idiosyncratic Twitter (TPOT) friends and soon-to-be-friends meetup, that’s mostly self-organized, i.e. some activities, hanging out, getting along, having fun and cooking. The goal is Being, together, in a cool location, for a week.

If you’re a non-Twitter friend of ours: There is a very cool scene that developed on Twitter where a bunch of people are talking to each other and getting to know each other. Like me, they care about philosophy and living well. [A wise man](https://twitter.com/visakanv) once called them “friendly ambitious nerds” — those are the people I like to hang out with and they tend to get along very well.

Last year, I hosted TREEWEEK, in a wish for all my friends (and friends to be) to come together. I also combined it with my birthday party, to which I invited IRL friends and parts of my family. I always thought I'd have to get married to be allowed to invite all my friends to a big garden party. Turns out you can also Just Do Things. How nice. : )

TREEWEEK was an experiment, a kick off, an initial spell cast. It worked very well ; )  
TREEWEEK TWO is the double down. [LFG](https://forms.gle/gTHswvP7RQQZf3TP9).

one of MANY jams but this was the birthday one!!!

### When?

TREEWEEK TWO takes place from September 15 to September 21 in this year of our lord, 2025.

Arrival is on Monday (15 Sep) and departure early on Sunday (21 Sep), so Saturday can be a full day of final conversations and extended goodbyes, without the pressure of having to leave.

[There is an art to saying goodbye](https://youtu.be/jKS6Q5Y31Ww), and I think a solid goodbye can really help form a subsequent relationship. And that's what we're here for: for friendship and love!

![](https://cdn-images.brick.do/easyimage/b9ac5316092ca5b4476d801a73693630fff272441dc39963.jpg)

### Is TREEWEEK TWO work-friendly?

Yes. Some people can't take a holiday or are busy running their own business. We have a room that has desks and plugs for office hours during the day. If you have a room ticket you can also use your own room.

The wifi is so/so but it works. Same with mobile reception in and around the venue. Working is not the focus of the event, so we can't guarantee for silence or completely undisturbed surroundings. 

But you'll definitely find space and time to get work done.

### Program & Focus

Attending [Jesscamp](http://www.liberalis.events/jesscamps/jesscamp4.html) 2 taught me that there is no program needed to make magic happen. All we need is a house and a garden, ample sustenance and some TREES, and beautiful days await, rain or shine.

This remains at the core of TREEWEEK's DNA. We as a team build and and hold the walls and the scaffolding, and together with you, fill it with love.

Observing what everyone was excited about last year, we thought we'd double down on some activities to make sure they can continue and grow:

- **Giant painting and arts & crafts in general**  
    We will bring back the collective giant painting and we'll have plenty of art supplies around for creative activity (BEADS!)
- **Music and jams**  
    I'll bring all my musical equipment again, so let's make some serious jams and bops again! We'll make ample space and time for that and I would love if we could record some sessions as well.
- **Workshop space and room scheduling**  
    We had some great workshops like PLAYFIGHTING, LARPING, CIRCLING and much more, and I remember people being quite excited about workshops taking place, so we will take care to create a solid room scheduling system.
- **The Ever Present Kitchen**  
    Under the gracious guidance of my young bro Lukas we're running our own kitchen all week. this year, we're building a more durable volunteer and helper system for cooking and dishes, which will result in reliably scheduled meals and the occasional helper shift you can plan your days around. 
- **Talent & music show**  
    Our location Blaue Blume hosted a talent show for music and poetry as part of their in-house programming last year. This show was so well populated by TREES and it was so good to see you all in your element, so we decided to rent their equipment and host a show for ourselves this time.
- **Garden, movement, fire and sauna**  
    We have two saunas that we will be running, probably one in the afternoon and one in the evening, and I'd love to, weather permitting, encourage more movement workshops, garden times, evening fires and nice congregations.
- **Planting a TREE**  
    Last year we planted an actual TREE and I'd be very curious how the fella is doing... let's see if we can plant another one or something.
- **PARTY**  
    We can party everyday anyway, and it's not gonna be my birthday this year, but we will have a big dedicated party as the weekend approaches. LFG!

### Where?

[Seegut Blaue Blume](https://seegut-blaueblume.de/en/) is a gorgeous manor with great amenities. When I found out about [the location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/icaoZPvWeiJTDn9b6) I was struck [by their philosophy](https://www.blaueblume.de/uber-uns/): 

_"Es geht uns um nichts Geringeres als die Wiederverzauberung der Welt."_

_=_

_"Our aim is nothing less than the re-enchantment of the world."_

I don't know about you, but I'm on board with that.

I envisioned a place with [water, earth, fire, air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAe1LwvWmZI), and an inside space, so we can vibe in all sorts of biomes and temperatures. I also wanted camping to be an option. Guess what? We got it all!

- **Water:** There is a lake on the property (not for swimming) and there are many many lakes a few steps away (for swimming), space for emotional fluidity.
- **Earth:** Plenty of TREES, forest and outside territory, campground with plenty of space, the grounding feeling in our feet.
- **Fire:** Two saunas, a fireplace inside and many fireplaces outside, a kitchen we'll be running, the love burning in our hearts.
- **Air:** Fresh autumny lake-territory air, early autumn winds, clear skies for stargazing, and the beauty of conversations with your friends.

If you're trying to become the Avatar, master of all elements, TREEWEEK might be for you!

Seegut Blaue Blume houses 50 people in beds, offers 25 spots for camping, and 5 spots for RVs. So the total capacity of TREEWEEK is give or take 80 people.

### What’s in it for you and what are the vibes?

Meet the homies, make new friends, live together inside and outside for a week, nice food that we’ll all cook together, extra time in Berlin before and/or after, celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of autumn.

Deep conversation, games and jokes and many laughs, cool meaningful experiences, showing each other your skills and views, self-organized events and activities, lots of MUSIC! Bathe in the very real magic of many like minded people. What's that smell in the air... is that... Love?

Let's be together, party together, let's write a bit of history together.

Afterwards (let’s say you’ve never been to a Twitter meetup before) your timeline is gonna be WAY better because now you’re replying to real people who you have experiences and in jokes with, and it really changes the quality of everything significantly.

For those of you who have some work to do and need to put some hours in, I'm very happy to provide some daytime workspace concentration zone. We do respect a hustler. You can also find friends for coworking, or as we like to call it in Berlin, coWORMing.

### Ticket Price and Generosity

The ticket tiering looks as follows:

- 850 EUR: Room Ticket Supporter (generates 1 reduced price ticket)
- 700 EUR: Room Ticket Standard
- 550 EUR: Room Ticket Reduced Price (for those in need)
- 550 EUR: Camping Ticket Supporter (generates 1 reduced price ticket)
- 400 EUR: Camping Ticket Standard

Additionally, the ticketing form will include a voluntary donation field to support reduced price tickets.

The rooms available are: 2 bed rooms, 3 bed rooms, 4/5 bed rooms and one 15 bed dorm, for a total of 50 beds. Ticket prices do not differ between the room types. Each room has an en-suite bathroom, the dorm has a whole ass sauna. The rooms are luxurious, you'll sleep like the monarchs you are.

Campers bring their own stuff. If you want to camp but you can't bring stuff, [contact us](mailto:TREEWEEK@nowmedia.org), maybe we can make something happen. There are around 25 camping spots and 5 RV spots available.

FYI: Last years' standard tickets were 600 EUR, so we went up by 100 EUR. The extra money goes towards the increased price the venue asked for. Like last year, I'm also getting paid off this event and I also wanna make sure that some pay comes around for my co-organizer. Other than that our budget remains the same. If we generate an excess of generosity that isn't used up by reduced ticket purchases, we will keep the money in a pool for TR33W33K reduced price tickets.

### Refunds

Full refunds available up to two weeks before the event (31. August 2025). After that date we can't guarantee refunds, but don't hesitate to reach out. If we aren't sold out it might help if you had someone in mind we can transfer your ticket to. 

### What's included, and what do you volunteer?

Included in your ticket is

- 6 nights accommodation
- all rooms in the house have their own bathroom
- campers have inside bathrooms right by the camp site
- bedding and room towels are included
- two saunas for 4hrs / day each
- 100 sauna towels for the whole event
- unlimited tea and coffee, plenty of snacks
- plenty of food all day, self serve breakfast, simple lunches and cooked dinners
    - our food will be mostly vegetarian and vegan, we're purchasing high quality, regional bio produce
    - protein will come in form of many eggs and legumes
    - we're trying to have daily meat & BBQs
- we have a great head chef (my brother Lukas!), and a cool recipe system (shoutouts to Microsolidarity and Dan!), so cooking will be well structured and deliiiicious
- budget for party, bs and art supplies
- and of course, many blessings and the great joy of friendship

You’ll volunteer:

- your unique spirit and your magic powers to make the event special
- your hands, head, joy and tastebuds for shifts in the kitchen and dishes
- your feet, for walking and dancing
- your care and attention, for yourself and others, to see when you and others are in need, so that you may communicate with that person (including yourself), to recognize their circumstances, and if possible / adequate, improve these circumstances, alert others, or just leave them be, for having been seen and witnessed, often makes our life better, our being more real, our soul more connected, to the infinite, and the great.

Not included but available:

- Alcohol: We will provide plenty of beer and wine (and I'm happy to accommodate some special orders). However, we ask you to put your name down and tally your drinks, and then pay us (at purchase price) before you leave.  
    In my experience there are many non-drinkers at these events and I don't want non-drinkers' money going towards alcohol.
- Meat: Similar to alcohol we will have a meat market on the side, where the meat chiefs will buy and cook meat, so you can pay them directly. At dinner time there will also be a BBQ going for meat eaters, weather and logistics permitting.

### Travel & Logistics 

From **Berlin Airport BER**, take the **FEX** (direction Berlin Central Station) **to Gesundbrunnen**, and change to the **RE3** (direction Stralsund) **to Prenzlau**. We will run a van shuttle between Prenzlau and Blaue Blume.

This RE3 also departs from **Berlin Central Station**.

The journey takes two hours by train, and 30 minutes by car. Please book your flights / travels in and out accordingly. Be in Berlin early so we don't have to pick you up at 1am or something.

The same goes for your return flight / trains. We will book a bus that will shuttle you all from Blaue Blume to Gesundbrunnen after breakfast, so you'll be at the airport in the afternoon.

If you come by car, come straight to [**Seegut Blaue Blume**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/icaoZPvWeiJTDn9b6). I'm very happy about some people coming by car! We'll need to do some shopping tours and picking people up, so drivers and vehicles are welcome.

When in doubt, contact us about your itinerary. Closer to the event we will send around forms to capture travel times to help you and us plan : )

As our groupchat fills, we encourage you to make travel plans together, and maybe find each other at the airport, to take the train ride as a crew. We will have to batch you in Prenzlau anyway to make sure we do full van trips. Traveling together will bring you close before the event even starts!

### Why are we doing this?

Visiting [Jesscamp](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/liberalisltd/1650003) and [Microsolidarity Camp](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/eu-summer-camp-2024) in Summer 2023 changed my life significantly, when it came to meeting people and furthering our personal development. I was also at [Xiqweek](https://xiqweek.brick.do/) and [Portal](https://portal-porto.brick.do/), which were great as well (and Porto can hardly be beaten as a location). Before that I was part of [Medley in Berlin](https://medley.berlin). With the path paved by these previous camps / meetups / residencies, I felt called to be a host / organizer myself and ventured out for TREEWEEK in 2024.

After TREEWEEK a Gravitational Field emerged in Berlin, which is pulling together a great scene of people. I'm helping stewarding and furthering that scene.

![](https://cdn-images.brick.do/easyimage/364340d2611e7e63fdcfc1184c6866fff0efa81b771814a6.jpg)

I think that many Twitter friends are often great mages looking for friends that can help them unleash their abilities. Being brought together as like minds allows for new fruitious connections of love, labor and friendship.

With TREEWEEK 2024, I fulfilled a life long dream to have my family and friends in one place. I also realized how much fun it is to throw a solid event, and to bring a strong crew together. There was so much love in the air, great connections, amazing meetings of hearts and minds, and people finding and fulfilling their potential.

![](https://cdn-images.brick.do/easyimage/f29d123370806e1ccc1cf68933a9ddee128840bfe344acad.jpg)

This year, Emergent and I are teaming up for spiritually the same event, with some extra sprinkles of art and magic, a more solid organization, and as many blessings as we can generate and find!

See you at TREEWEEK TWO!

### See you there!

We're so excited for this! This will be cozy, vibey, tasty, swaggy, magical and just really damn good. We can't wait to carry the TREE!

### PS: Berlin Afterburner

Sometimes the best festival is after the festival. You're encouraged to plan a longer stay in Berlin, around the event. We as a team might be a bit busy right before, and a bit tired right after, but some cozy dinners and hangs should work out. Most of us live and hang in east Berlin (Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Neukölln). Plan a stay and hit us up.

It's my birthday on the 28th, one week after the event, so we can celebrate again!!!

One last time but quiet:
