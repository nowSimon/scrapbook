**What if we had an evolving metaphor, a living image, to describe our life and work make it more joyful? "The Village" is a workshop which invites you to take a step back from your life and work, in order to gain an overview and to understand yourself better.**

By splitting life and work into different visual areas, participants increase their self-understanding, resource themselves where needed and increase the efficacy and creativity of their work.

**This workshop contains:**

- Lecture & Conversation
- Meditation
- Creative Exercise

**After this  workshop participants will:**

- know themselves better
- understand each other better
- feel refreshed, inspired and unblocked
- have a mental or a physical image that represents an overview of their life and work
- do more meaningful and effective work — closer to their life's work.

> _"I think the reason that The Village really speaks to me is it does a great job of delineating all the areas of life. Creative brains are so interconnected and so it’s so useful to separate the different areas, focus on each, and then see the interplay."_ **— Workshop Attendee**

#### Hawraa Alsayegh, Clinical Pharmacologist @ Kings College London, had this to say after attending an iteration of The Village:

> _Simon introduced me to the magical concept of ”The Village” over a year ago. This revelation unlocked a journey of self-discovery for me. At a challenging time during my first master's program, I was seeking inspiration and encouragement. Participating in these sessions filled me with an energy I didn't realize I needed. It sparked my imagination about my ideal living environment — picturing my metaphorical garden, envisioning my house, and considering the walls that allowed me to be my true, unguarded self._
> 
> _This concept of always having a ‘garden’ where I could freely express myself led me to reevaluate what I truly desired and how it fits into my personal ’village’. It transformed my perspective on life both professionally as a researcher and as in my personal life. My colleagues and professors were captivated as I shared the story of the ‘village’, recognizing the profound simplicity and importance of bringing such a vision to reality._
> 
> _This experience has been pivotal in shaping my decision to continue my education at a research institute and university in London, further refining what my ’new village‘ looks like. It has taught me the joy of manifesting and implementing the village model in my life. I wholeheartedly recommend engaging with this experience and working with Simon. His unique and creative perspective, coupled with a passion for sharing knowledge and experiences, in the long run might just change your life, as it did mine._
