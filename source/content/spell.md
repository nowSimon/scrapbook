Your life is essentially built on memes. Memes are easily repeatable phrases with a deep lore of meaning behind them. That is also what a spell is: You say it often enough and it actually starts forming your world.

Your thought machine is yapping all the time, whether you want it or not. There is a pyramid of spells in your brain/being and the largest, lowest building block is made of short spells it repeats aaaalllll the time. They better be damn good.

Over the years I’ve consciously loaded a bunch of spells into this lowest building block and I think it’s one of the highest impact things you can do to change your life significantly.

This is the soil in which the garden of your life grows. Better tend to it.
