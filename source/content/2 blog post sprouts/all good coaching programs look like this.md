btw all good coaching programs look like this:

session 1: introduction, mostly just vibes and story telling, the client introduces him/her/themself/ves, the coach asks questions and makes guesses to get a sense of the topography of the situation and the problem.

session 2: the coach introduces the core help-concept. depending on the program customization level that will be premeditated or developed from the client's problem scape in session 1.

session 3: the client has test-driven the core help-concept. the coach and the client review it together. this is likely an emotional session, because introducing a new factor in a central (& troubled!) area of life has emotional effects.

session 4: the client has worked through some emotions and will enter this session with increased clarity. or he may have reverted to old patterns. no 4 is always a wild card. be as open as in session 1.

session 5: you're beginning to conclude the program. this is undoubtedly a moment of clarity. it's a good time for the client to get creative and to customize the help-concept. where you introduced the help-concept in session 2, it's time for the client to introduce their own help-concept to you!

session 6: conclude, compare the state you are in now with session 1. is there progress? has there been change? how happy are we? is anything left unsaid? shall we continue working together? leave lots of space for both of you. a good time to be humble, to drop the veil, to rejoice in having overcome -- together.
