## closing loops program

I'll coach you through this in 6 sessions. 

**session 1: all about you**, I need to know about you, who you are, what you struggle with, what you've tried, etc. we will get to know each other, so that I can tailor my work to you. we will also discuss the concept of loops and what that means to you, and how I see it.

**session 2: I'll teach you my loop capture system** and tell you how it works. you will have a chance to adopt and adapt this as we work together. in this session we will write down alllll of your open loops and see what effect that has.

**session 3: review how loop capture works for you** and talk about emotions that come up related to your open loops or attempts to close them. take a high resolution look at your loops that allows you to deep dive into actual work. we'll also expand your sense of personal knowledge management.

**session 4: tbd** number 4 is the magic number here, it's the high point. that's why I like to leave it as a wild card. this session usually releases some energy, emotions come up. we'll be spontaneous here depending on what comes up.

**session 5: adaptation time.** how would this system work better for you? we'll have introduced adaptations before, but this is really your chance to customize this system and to go home with a sense of ownership over the unique way you close your loops.

**session 6: let's conclude**, compare the state you are in now with session 1. is there progress? has there been change? how happy are we? can we refine the work we've done? is anything left unsaid? shall we continue working together? leave lots of space for both of you. a good time to be humble, to drop the veil, to rejoice in having overcome -- together.
