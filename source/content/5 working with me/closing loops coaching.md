my full closing loop program contains 6 sessions:




3 tiers:

1 off introduction: introduces the most important concepts. (~~250 EUR~~ 99 EUR)

= session 1 of mini program 

is incomplete:
	- because it's a one-off it's not a habit builder
	- not enough time to deep dive the concepts
	- potentially less emotionally attuned 
	- -> not a program, more like a spontaneous session that mixes your needs with my suggestions


3 session mini program (500 EUR = 166 p/s): 

session 1: = 1&2
session 2: = 3&4
session 3: = 5&6


6 session full program: (800 EUR = 133 p/s)

session 1: all about you, I need to know about you, who you are, what you struggle with, what you've tried, etc. we will get to know each other. we will also discuss the concept of loops and what that means to you, and how I see it.

session 2: I'll teach you my to do list system and tell you how it works. you will have a chance to adopt and adapt this as we work together. into this list we will dump alllll of your open loops. and see what effect that has.

session 3: review how that works and talk about emotions that come up related to your open loops or attempts to close them

session 4: tbd big wildcard depending on how other sessions go

session 5: adaptation time: how would this system work better for you? we'll have introduced adaptations before, but this is really your chance to customize this system and to go home with a sense of ownership over the unique way you close your loops.

session 6: conclude, compare the state you are in now with session 1. is there progress? has there been change? how happy are we? is anything left unsaid? shall we continue working together? leave lots of space for both of you. a good time to be humble, to drop the veil, to rejoice in having overcome -- together.













I hit a viral tweet yesterday, it's still going:

https://x.com/simon_ohler/status/1985048224642589041

it reads:

>**oh yeah if you guys don't know yet, you gotta close your loops. I think identifying and closing my loops reduced my suffering by 80-90%.**
>
>**if anyone wants "closing loops coaching" let me know, I'm very good at doing it & teaching it.**


some people texted me and were like, yeah I want help with that. cool. if you need help with that, here is the program that would look like:

we'll do 6 sessions @ 90 minutes each:

session 1: all about you, I need to know about you, who you are, what you struggle with, what you've tried, etc. we will get to know each other.

session 2: I'll teach you my to do list system and tell you how it works. you will adopt and adapt this as we work together. in this session you will 

session 3: you will have tested the to-do list system





Q: How do you close a loop with someone who has cut you out of their life and there is no way to communicate with them?

A: this is a matter of forgiveness. you could write a letter, pour your heart out and either send it, or not keep it, or burn it, or let it float away on the water. the letter helps you get things off your chest, then you can forgive and pray to uncouple yourself from the other.
