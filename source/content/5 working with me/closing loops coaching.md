I hit a viral tweet yesterday, it's still going:

it reads:

>**oh yeah if you guys don't know yet, you gotta close your loops. I think identifying and closing my loops reduced my suffering by 80-90%.**
>
>**if anyone wants "closing loops coaching" let me know, I'm very good at doing it & teaching it.**


some people texted me and were like, yeah I want help with that. cool. if you need help with that, here is the program that would look like:

we'll do 6 sessions @ 90 minutes each:

session 1: all about you, I need to know about you, who you are, what you struggle with, what you've tried, etc. we will get to know each other.

session 2: I'll teach you my to do list system and tell you how it works. you will adopt and adapt this as we work together. in this session you will 

session 3: you will have tested the to-do list system


here are questions for you:

1) I guess you're you're struggling with some of the following things
	1) to do list sprawl and decay (you make a to do list and it gets out of date and it frustrates you; you don't know how to identify what to do next)
	2) you can't estimate how long tasks take you
	3) you have a hard time prioritizing
	4) you waste time on your phone (or in other ingenious ways)
   Please correct me if I'm wrong, or specify.
2) What do you want to get done? ()


Q: How do you close a loop with someone who has cut you out of their life and there is no way to communicate with them?

A: this is a matter of forgiveness. you could write a letter, pour your heart out and either send it, or not keep it, or burn it, or let it float away on the water. the letter helps you get things off your chest, then you can forgive and pray to uncouple yourself from the other.
