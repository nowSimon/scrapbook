my full closing loop program contains 6 sessions:

**session 1: all about you**, I need to know about you, who you are, what you struggle with, what you've tried, etc. we will get to know each other. we will also discuss the concept of loops and what that means to you, and how I see it.

**session 2: I'll teach you my loop capture system** and tell you how it works. you will have a chance to adopt and adapt this as we work together. in this session we will write down alllll of your open loops. and see what effect that has.

**session 3: review how loop capture works for you** and talk about emotions that come up related to your open loops or attempts to close them. take a high resolution look at your loops that allows you 

session 4: tbd big wildcard depending on how other sessions go

session 5: adaptation time: how would this system work better for you? we'll have introduced adaptations before, but this is really your chance to customize this system and to go home with a sense of ownership over the unique way you close your loops.

session 6: conclude, compare the state you are in now with session 1. is there progress? has there been change? how happy are we? is anything left unsaid? shall we continue working together? leave lots of space for both of you. a good time to be humble, to drop the veil, to rejoice in having overcome -- together.



3 tiers:

1 off introduction: introduces the most important concepts. (~~250 EUR~~ 99 EUR)

= session 1 of mini program 

is incomplete:
	- because it's a one-off it's not a habit builder
	- not enough time to deep dive the concepts
	- potentially less emotionally attuned 
	- -> not a program, more like a spontaneous session that mixes your needs with my suggestions


3 session mini program (500 EUR = 166 p/s): 

session 1: = 1&2
session 2: = 3&4
session 3: = 5&6


6 session full program: (800 EUR = 133 p/s)





here are questions for you:

1) I guess you're you're struggling with some of the following things
	1) to do list sprawl and decay (you make a to do list and it gets out of date and it frustrates you; you don't know how to identify what to do next)
	2) you can't estimate how long tasks take you
	3) you have a hard time prioritizing
	4) you waste time on your phone (or in other ingenious ways)
   Please correct me if I'm wrong, or specify.
2) What do you want to get done? ()
