someone asked me: simon, you say you do "voice coaching". what is that and how does it work?

and I replied:


> it works via video / audio call, so we'll get into a gmeet / zoom.
> 
> at first I'd ask you what you want to work on with regards to your voice. I'm guessing you're interested in this because you sense you want do work on or with your voice somehow?  
> 
> then we'll talk about this a bit and I'll be paying close attention to your voice and note things that seem interesting to me, so we can discuss them. I'm very attuned to voices so this is why I'm specializing in this among other things. 
> 
> what comes up most are things related to truth-speaking, authenticity and also emotional matters. trapped emotions often appear in the voice.
> 
> **the goal is to bring your voice into authentic resonance.** that only works when the obstacles that block the flow are addressed properly.
> 
> with my last clients very interesting things came up. one situation was about their environment and whether they could speak the truth, with another I got into chakra work... with some I did mostly talking, with some we did some interesting voice & resonance exercises.
> 
> the voice is a great place to enter into someone's inner world so it's very effective to work with it. also strange! a lot of stuff comes up :D

Jenn worked with me on her voice & resonance and she had these takeaways:

- Was useful to hear when he felt I was being truthful, and when I was not
- I realized that I often times soften how I feel to make other people feel seen
- I realized I need to find a group of people I can be myself with
- I realized that I am suppressing a part of myself by not speaking freely around people who do not want to listen to my ideas
- Simon reintroduced the idea of resonance, specifically through the voice, and how you can feel when something is in resonance vs when it is not. I will have to continue to practice this
- It was also nice to speak with someone that is accepting of my "crazy thoughts"
- I also realized I was overdue for a visit to Europe :)
