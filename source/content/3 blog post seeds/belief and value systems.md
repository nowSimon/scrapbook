What are values and what are beliefs?

Values are innate, they’re in your DNA.

Beliefs can feel like that, but you can actually change them.

  

Let’s forget about your beliefs right now, let’s focus on values. What are your values? Write down 5.

  

Now often time people write down values based on their aspirations. I want you to observe yourself like a child. If you had/have a kid, and you observe your kid, can you imagine your his or her values?

  

Now think of what you do every day. If you had a pie chart of where your time goes every day, what are the top 5 activities? So write down 5 values as per behavior. Be honest!
