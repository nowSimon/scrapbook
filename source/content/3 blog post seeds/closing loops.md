here are questions for you:

1) I guess you're you're struggling with some of the following things
	1) to do list sprawl and decay (you make a to do list and it gets out of date and it frustrates you; you don't know how to identify what to do next)
	2) you can't estimate how long tasks take you
	3) you have a hard time prioritizing
	4) you waste time on your phone (or in other ingenious ways)
   Please correct me if I'm wrong, or specify.
2) What do you want to get done? ()
